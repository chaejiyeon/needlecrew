  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/icons/main/
    - assets/images/
    - assets/images/useguide/
    - assets/images/useguide/guideImage/
    - assets/images/fixClothes/
    - assets/images/takeFix/
    - assets/images/startPage/
    - assets/images/mypage/
    - assets/icons/
    - assets/icons/useinfo/
    - assets/icons/fixClothes/
    - assets/icons/alramInfo/
    - assets/icons/myPage/
    - assets/icons/startPage/
  #   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: NotoSansCJKkrRegular
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/NotoSansCJKkr-Regular.otf
    - family: NotoSansCJKkrBlack
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/NotoSansCJKkr-Black.otf
    - family: NotoSansCJKkrMedium
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/NotoSansCJKkr-Medium.otf

  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
